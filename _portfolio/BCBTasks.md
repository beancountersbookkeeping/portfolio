## Explanation
BCB Tasks was created as a task management and time keeping system. It is used to keep track of employees time and tasks left to do for each client that is assigned to the employee. 

## Problem

Most systems today either have tasks for employees or time keeping. The very few that have both are very cumbersome and difficult to use. This program strives to ease the use and management of these. 

## Solution

An interactive "To Do" page was created that shows the users tasks that are left to complete. Hiding the completed ones. It is also interactive to time and record the users time for each task prior to completion. 

## Results

This one page view is essential to the ease of use, it allows users to view and record all on one view. Eliminating complicated programs and time spent accomplishing this. 

## Conclusion

The project taught me a lot about user interfaces and coding.  I used HTML, CSS, Ruby and Javascript for this project. The most complcated part was creating a timer for each task and having it produce accurate results. The timer was completed in Javascript and was embedded into a Ruby program. This was a challenge to properly integrate the two programming languages.
