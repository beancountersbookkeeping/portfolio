## Explanation

CoolJams was created as a Spotify style site. It is used to show case artist's albums and to provide the ability to listen to songs. 

## Problem

The site was set up to show mutliple different ablums, click to see futher information, graphics and songs. The songs then play and pause based on user interaction. There is also the ability to click to the next or previous song. 

## Solution

A player bar was created to hold user interactions of the song. It has the ability to play / pause the song. It can move to the next song or play the previous song. A seek bar was also added to see where in the song is playing and fast forward or reqind the song. This gives the user a great user experience. 

## Results

The player bar is essential in the user interface. It deploys the needed song tools to listen to songs and move around songs. While providing the ability to see all of the songs and move the page in the background. 

## Conclusion

The project taught me a lot about user interfaces and coding. Using angular to cut down on coding but icrease functionality. I will use this in the future to increase my coding knowldege.  A key thing I learned is about layering objects on pages, how this can help the visual aspects and keep functionality.
