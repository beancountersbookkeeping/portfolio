## Explanation

CoolJams was created as a Spotify style music site. It is used to showcase artist's albums and to provide the ability to listen to songs.

## Problem

The site was set up to show mutliple different ablums; with the ability to click on the album to see further information, graphics and songs. The songs then plays and pauses based on user interaction. There is also the ability to click to the next or previous song.

## Solution

A player bar was created to hold user interactions of the song. It has the ability to play / pause the song. It can move to the next song or play the previous song. A seek bar was also added to see where in the song is playing and fast forward or rewind the song. This gives the user, a great user experience.

## Results

The player bar is essential in the user interface. It deploys the needed song tools to listen to songs and move around songs. While providing the ability to see all of the songs and move the page in the background.

## Conclusion

The project taught me a lot about user interfaces and coding. Using angular to cut down on coding but increase functionality. I will use this in the future to increase my coding knowledge.  A key thing I learned is about layering objects on pages, how this can help the visual aspects and keep functionality.

This project was originally created using DOM scripting and jQuery to understand the formatting in Javascript. It was then reconfigured using Angular. I learned a lot about the user interface and different ways to accomplish an action. I also learned about the pros and cons of using DOM and jQuery vs. Angular.
