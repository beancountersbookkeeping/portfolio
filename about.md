Kaylin is the owner and founder of Bean Counters Bookkeeping. Her interest in small businesses began in college, while working for a successful small business called Bike Cycles in Wilmington, North Carolina. There she received hands on training in business management and came face to face with the daily challenges a small business faces.
 
After completing her Master's of Science in Accountancy at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, she worked for the U.S. Army Audit Agency for over three years. It was here she learned the methods of detailed accounting and auditing. After working for the government, Kaylin discovered her interest in small businesses was not fulfilled and there was a burning desire within to become an entrepreneur.
