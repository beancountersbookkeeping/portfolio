Kaylin is the owner and founder of Bean Counters Bookkeeping. My interest in small businesses began in college, while working for a successful small business called Bike Cycles in Wilmington, North Carolina. There I received hands on training in business management and came face to face with the daily challenges a small business faces.

After completing her Master's of Science in Accountancy at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, I worked for the U.S. Army Audit Agency for over three years. It was here I learned the methods of detailed accounting and auditing. After working for the government, I discovered her interest in small businesses was not fulfilled and there was a burning desire within to become an entrepreneur.

Throughout the years, I have held an interest in computers and programming starting in High School. There is one major lesson I learned the hard way that is similar to accounting. In accounting, everything has to be exactly accurate. This is from the amount of the transaction, if you put a comma in an incorrect position, you can be $100 or $1,000 off. This is the same as forgetting a semi-colon after a curly bracket of a function or putting a colon there. Then the entire line is incorrect in both. In accounting, you have to tell the program that you are using the type of transaction that you are dealing with. For example, you treat a bill payment differently than expense. Similarly, in JavaScript you treat an array differently than a string.

There is one more thing about accounting that I have finally understood many years later. There are many technically competent accountants out there in the world. There are less accountants who can truly understand the accounting world. They can use their critical thinking to not only perform the function, but perform it in the best way. While I am still in school in Bloc as I am writing this. I plan on using my critical thinking to not just become a technically competent computer programmer, but a great one.
