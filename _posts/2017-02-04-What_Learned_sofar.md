title: What I Have Learned so far at Bloc
---

I have learned to use multiple different programming languages and tool at Bloc. 


Git and GitHub – Here I have learned how to create my own repository. I have learned the importance of creating a new branch to program and adjust, so that later I can accept or reject changes from that branch. I have learned how to pull information to and from my local computer so that I can work on the project. 

Brackets – I have learned that this is a simple tool to open and write the code to save to the project. 

HTML – Hypertext Markup Language - This language provides the structure to the project. If it is one page, or multiple pages and how those pages are set up. For example, Headers, Footers and Titles. 

CSS – Cascading Style Sheet - This is used to style the objects or sections of the project. That includes color, size, and opacity. 

JavaScript – This is a dynamic programming language. It is very powerful and can run scripts and functions. This is the part of the site or project that interacts with the user. It can accept and change the outputs based on the user interactions. 

DOM Scripting – Document Object Model – This is a way of manipulating data and objects in JavaScript. 

JQuery  - JQuery takes DOM scripting a step further. Here you must link to a library and can use pre-written code to achieve an action. A downside though is that it starts to affect load speed vs. DOM scripting to get that functionality. 

Angular – Angular continues to build on DOM Scripting and JQuery. But Angular is the framework for the code, not the library. Angular is used for Single Page Applications and high animations and effects. 

Grunt – Grunt is a JavaScript Task runner, that means that it performs frequently used tasks. To see my project as I saved it. I ran Grunt from my GitShell and opened a webpage using the localhost. This allowed me to see what my project looked like to make needed adjustments. 

Jekyll – Jekyll is a platform to create static websites. It is very simple to create Blog Websites using Jekyll. Once the structure is set up (HTML) then all that is needed is a new page (.md) in the proper format. Then the blog will add itself to the site. To see what the site looks like we run ‘Jekyll serve’ then open a browser using the IP address given. 


This is just an outline of the items that I have learned at Bloc. As I continue to learn, this outline will fill in and become more complex. I look forward to continuing my learning.
