title: My History with Professions
---

I have always had an interest in computers. Since High School I took my first computer programming class, C+ and C++. While I have gotten away from that, when I went to college it always interested in. 

The final for our C++ class was to create an output that then took instructions from the user and changed the output. My friend on the computer next to me created a similar program but had a backwards output. Our output was a stick figure man on each computer that appeared to be punching each other. When we hit the keyboard, the arms on the output would switch. Then the computers appear to be boxing each other. Well we got an A for creativity. 

My friend went on to be an electrical engineer, while I went into Accounting. I went into accounting because I love the small business and start up world. But accounting isnâ€™t the only industry where I can stay and work in this world. 

There is one major lesson I learned the hard way that is similar to accounting. In accounting, everything has to be exactly accurate. This is from the amount of the transaction, if you put a comma in an incorrect position, you can be $100 or $1,000 off. This is the same as forgetting a semi-colon after a curly bracket of a function or putting a colon there. Then the entire line is incorrect in both. In accounting, you have to tell the program that you are using the type of transaction that you are dealing with. For example, you treat a bill payment differently than expense. Similarly, in JavaScript you treat an array differently than a string. 

There is one more thing about accounting that I have finally understood many years later. There are many technically competent accountants out there in the world. There are less accountants who can truly understand the accounting world. They can use their critical thinking to not only perform the function, but perform it in the best way. While I am still in school in Bloc as I am writing this. I plan on using my critical thinking to not just become a technically competent computer programmer, but a great one.
