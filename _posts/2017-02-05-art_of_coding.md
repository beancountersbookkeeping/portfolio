To code a website is almost like creating a picture. You start with a blank canvas and an idea. Then you add a little structure sketching to see where on the picture you want an item to be. Just to make sure that it will be like what you have in mind. In coding, you would create a repository and add a little HTML to create the basic structure. Then you look at the canvas for a little bit. 

You decide how do you want to do the picture. Do you want it to be a sketch, an oil canvas, or 3D? In our case, do you want it dynamic, on multiple pages or a single page application? Then you might sketch a little more; or add a couple of pages / files / pictures to your repository file. Link the pages to the main HTML file. 

Then you start, with the first great brushstroke of massive color across the canvas. You mix colors and gain excitement your brush moves across the canvas, filling in the blank areas. As you are coding and creating JavaScript files, you are coding with excitement. You have files and folders. Services and Controllers, they are all linking together and depending on each other to perform a task. 

Then the step back. You stop. You look at your canvas. You pull up your website in a browser. What does it look like? Does it work? You might go back and tweak that edge line of the painting. Or decide that you forgot something or change some functionality of the website. 

You are almost done; the structure is good. The items work. Now how does it look. You pull out your micro brushes and dab a little here and a little there. You add a little texture to the painting. A little bit of details.  You create a couple more CSS objects in your project. You change the color, size, opacity. Maybe you move the box around. Vertical, no horizontal, no vertical. 

It looks good. It works. You have finished.
