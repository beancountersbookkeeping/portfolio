title: What I Have Learned so far at Bloc Part 2
---

I have learned to use multiple different programming languages and tool at Bloc.

Ruby - Object oriented programming language.

Rails - Model, View, Controller framework used by the Ruby language to provide structure.

Atom - The text editor used to create applications.

rSpec - Testing tool used in Test Driven Development, where the tests are written first then the coding to make sure that the function works.

Faker Gem - Gem used to create fake data to seed a database.

Pundit Gem - Gem for authorization to make sure that certain criteria are met.

Stripe Api - Stripe API allows for payments to be made in the application.

Devise Gem - Gem that allows users to sign up and sign in/out of the application.


This is just an outline of the items that I have learned at Bloc. As I continue to learn, this outline will fill in and become more complex. I look forward to continuing my learning.
